During conference days (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday), the mornings
are unscheduled time. There are numerous options. Note that, although some of
these look like pure recreation, we have some of our most interesting
discussions once the structure and constraints are completely removed.

## **Hiking**

There are numerous hikes available and I often lead some:

- Around Lake Irwin: relatively flat, beautiful scenery. Good for a first hike when
  you're not sure about how the altitude will affect you.
- The far end of the lower loop, starting at gunsight pass bridge.
- The top of Mt. Crested Butte, taking the ski lift up from the bottom.
- Copper Creek, starting just past Gothic.

## **Other Outdoor Activities**

- Mountain biking. Crested Butte is famous for their trails and they come in all levels.
- Float down the Gunnison River starting at Garlic Mike's.
- Fishing
- Stand-Up Paddleboarding
- Cruising around town on a townie bike

## **Morning Workshops**

People often spontaneously decide to create their own workshops to investigate a
particular idea or technology. Rooms at the Parish Hall are usually available,
or you can hold them at one of the rental houses or in my living room (which has
a Chromecast-enabled TV).

## **Rest and Recovery**

In case you need to get used to the altitude, or to work on your own, or just
recover from life.
